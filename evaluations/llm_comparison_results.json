    "Gemini 2.5 Flash_answer": "Skyro's fraud detection system identifies and prevents fraudulent transactions in real-time by combining machine learning models and rule-based engines (Document 1, Document 2).\n\nThe system operates through the following mechanisms:\n\n*   **Architecture Components** (Document 1, Document 2, Document 3, Document 4):\n    *   **Real-Time Scoring Engine:** This engine uses a Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost) machine learning model with over 200 features to analyze transactions. It is built with Python and FastAPI, deployed on Kubernetes, and designed for high performance, achieving a latency of less than 100ms for the 95th percentile and a throughput of 10,000 requests per second.\n    *   **Rule Engine:** This component applies pre-defined rules for immediate decisions. Examples include velocity checks (e.g., more than 5 transactions in 10 minutes), geographic impossibility (transactions from different continents within 1 hour), amount anomalies (transaction 10x higher than average), and blacklisted cards, IPs, or devices.\n    *   **Feature Store:** This central repository provides key features for fraud scoring, including user behavior (average transaction amount, frequency, time of day patterns), device fingerprinting (browser type, screen resolution, timezone, IP address), transaction details (amount, merchant category, currency), network analysis (connection to known fraudulent accounts), and historical patterns (chargeback history, declined transactions).\n\n*   **Fraud Score Calculation and Decisioning** (Document 3, Document 4):\n    *   The system calculates a fraud score ranging from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates a greater likelihood of fraud.\n    *   Based on this score, transactions are assigned to different risk bands, which dictate the subsequent action:\n        *   **0-20 (Low risk):** Auto-approve.\n        *   **21-40 (Low-medium risk):** Auto-approve with monitoring.\n        *   **41-60 (Medium risk):** Request additional verification (e.g., 2FA, email confirmation).\n        *   **61-80 (High risk):** Manual review required.\n        *   **81-100 (Very high risk):** Auto-decline and flag account.\n\n*   **Machine Learning Model Details** (Document 3, Document 4, Document 5):\n    *   The model is trained on 50 million historical transactions (from the last 18 months), including 150,000 confirmed fraud cases. Class imbalance in the training data is addressed using SMOTE oversampling.\n    *   As of October 2024, the model exhibits a Precision of 87%, Recall of 92%, F1 Score of 89%, False Positive Rate of 1.2%, and an AUC-ROC of 0.96.\n    *   The model is retrained weekly with new data, undergoes A/B testing before deployment, and has a rollback mechanism to address performance degradation.\n\n*   **Integration with Payment System** (Document 5):\n    *   When a payment request arrives at the gateway, the gateway synchronously calls the fraud detection API.\n    *   The fraud score is returned within 100ms, and the payment is processed according to the score threshold.\n    *   All decisions are logged to a data warehouse for subsequent analysis.",

A payment request arrives at the payment gateway.\n2.  The gateway makes a synchronous API call to the fraud detection system.\n3.  The system analyzes the transaction using its two main components: a Rule Engine and a Real-Time Scoring Engine.\n4.  A fraud score is calculated and returned to the gateway within 100ms.\n5.  The payment is processed according to the action dictated by the fraud score.\n6.  All decisions are logged to a data warehouse for analysis.\n\n**System Components**\n\n*   **Rule Engine:** This engine applies pre-defined rules for instant decisions on clear-cut fraud patterns. These rules include:\n    *   **Velocity checks:** e.g., more than 5 transactions in 10 minutes.\n    *   **Geographic impossibility:** e.g., transactions from different continents within one hour.\n    *   **Amount anomalies:** e.g., a transaction 10 times higher than the user's average.\n    *   **Blacklists:** Checks against blacklisted cards, IP addresses, and devices.\n\n*   **Real-Time Scoring Engine:** This component uses a Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost) machine learning model to generate a risk score.\n    *   **Technology:** Python with FastAPI, deployed on Kubernetes.\n    *   **Performance:** Designed to handle 10,000 requests per second with a latency of less than 100ms.\n    *   **Features:** The model uses over 200 features for scoring, including user behavior, device fingerprinting, transaction details, and historical patterns.\n\n**Fraud Score and Actions**\n\nThe system calculates a fraud score ranging from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates a higher likelihood of fraud. Specific actions are tied to different score bands:\n*   **0-20 (Low risk):** Auto-approve.\n*   **21-40 (Low-medium risk):** Auto-approve with monitoring.\n*   **41-60 (Medium risk):** Request additional verification (e.g., 2FA).\n*   **61-80 (High risk):** Send to a queue for manual review.\n*   **81-100 (Very high risk):** Auto-decline the transaction and flag the account.\n\n**Model Maintenance and Monitoring**\n\n*   **Retraining:** The machine learning model is retrained weekly with new data to adapt to emerging fraud patterns.\n*   **Alerting:** The system uses Slack to alert teams about high-risk transactions requiring manual review and PagerDuty for critical API performance issues.\n*   **Monitoring:** A daily dashboard tracks fraud rates, false positives, and overall model performance.",

Here's how it works:\n\n### **System Overview**\n- The system uses both machine learning models and rule-based engines to detect fraudulent transactions.\n- It processes transactions in real-time, providing responses within strict latency requirements.\n\n### **Key Components**\n1. **Real-Time Scoring Engine**\n   - **Technology:** Python with FastAPI, deployed on Kubernetes.\n   - **Performance:**\n     - Latency: < 100ms for the 95th percentile.\n     - Throughput: 10,000 requests per second.\n   - **Model:** Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost) with over 200 features.\n   - **Source:** [Document 1, Document 2]\n\n2. **Rule Engine**\n   - Applies pre-defined rules for instant decisions, including:\n     - **Velocity checks:** Detects unusual transaction frequency (e.g., more than 5 transactions in 10 minutes).\n     - **Geographic impossibility:** Flags transactions from different continents within 1 hour.\n     - **Amount anomalies:** Identifies transactions 10x higher than the user's average.\n     - **Blacklisted cards/IPs/devices:** Blocks known fraudulent entities.\n   - **Source:** [Document 1, Document 2]\n\n3. **Feature Store**\n   - Uses key features for fraud scoring, such as:\n     - **User behavior:** Average transaction amount, frequency, time of day patterns.\n     - **Device fingerprinting:** Browser type, screen resolution, timezone, IP address.\n     - **Transaction details:** Amount, merchant category, currency.\n     - **Network analysis:** Connection to known fraudulent accounts.\n     - **Historical patterns:** Chargeback history, declined transactions.\n   - **Source:** [Document 3, Document 4]\n\n### **Fraud Score Calculation**\n- **Score Range:** 0-100 (higher = more likely fraud).\n- **Score Bands:**\n  - **0-20:** Low risk \u2013 Auto-approve.\n  - **21-40:** Low-medium risk \u2013 Auto-approve with monitoring.\n  - **41-60:** Medium risk \u2013 Request additional verification (2FA, email confirmation).\n  - **61-80:** High risk \u2013 Manual review required.\n  - **81-100:** Very high risk \u2013 Auto-decline and flag account.\n- **Source:** [Document 3, Document 4]\n\n### **Machine Learning Model**\n- **Training Data:**\n  - 50 million historical transactions (last 18 months).\n  - 150,000 confirmed fraud cases (positive samples).\n  - Class imbalance handled using SMOTE oversampling.\n- **Performance (as of October 2024):**\n  - Precision: 87%.\n  - Recall: 92%.\n  - F1 Score: 89%.\n  - False Positive Rate: 1.2%.\n  - AUC-ROC: 0.96.\n- **Retraining:** Weekly with new data, including A/B testing and rollback mechanisms if performance degrades.\n- **Source:** [Document 4, Document 5]\n\n### **Integration with Payment System**\n- Payment requests are processed synchronously via an API call to the fraud detection system.\n- The fraud score is returned within 100ms, and the payment is processed based on the score threshold.\n- All decisions are logged for analysis.\n- **Source:** [Document 5]\n\n### **Alerting and Monitoring**\n- Slack alerts for high-risk transactions requiring manual review.\n- Daily dashboards showing fraud rates, false positives, and model performance.\n- PagerDuty escalation if API latency exceeds 200ms or error rate > 1%.\n- **Source:** [Document 5]\n\n### **Known Limitations**\n- **Cold-start problem:** New users with limited history pose challenges in scoring.\n- **First-party fraud:** The system cannot detect certain types of friendly fraud.\n- **Source:** [Document 5]\n\nThis structured approach ensures that Skyro's fraud detection system efficiently balances speed, accuracy, and security.",

    "Llama 3.3 8B_answer": "The fraud detection system used by Skyro works by combining machine learning models and rule-based engines to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time. Here's a breakdown of the system's components and workflow:\n\n* The system consists of three main components: the Real-Time Scoring Engine, the Rule Engine, and the Feature Store.\n* The Real-Time Scoring Engine uses a Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost) model with over 200 features to analyze transactions and assign a fraud score. This engine is built using Python with FastAPI and deployed on Kubernetes, with a latency of less than 100ms for the 95th percentile and a throughput of 10,000 requests per second (Source: Document 1 - fraud_detection_system.md).\n* The Rule Engine applies pre-defined rules for instant decisions, including velocity checks, geographic impossibility, amount anomalies, and blacklisted cards/IPs/devices (Source: Document 1 - fraud_detection_system.md and Document 2 - fraud_detection_system.md).\n* The Feature Store provides key features used for fraud scoring, such as user behavior, device fingerprinting, transaction details, network analysis, and historical patterns (Source: Document 3 - fraud_detection_system.md and Document 4 - fraud_detection_system.md).\n* The fraud score is calculated based on a range of 0-100, with higher scores indicating a higher likelihood of fraud. The score bands are used to determine the course of action, ranging from auto-approval to manual review and auto-decline (Source: Document 3 - fraud_detection_system.md and Document 4 - fraud_detection_system.md).\n* The system's performance is monitored, with metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, false positive rate, and AUC-ROC being tracked (Source: Document 5 - fraud_detection_system.md).\n\nOverall, the system's workflow involves analyzing transactions in real-time, applying rules and machine learning models to assign a fraud score, and making decisions based on that score. While the system is designed to detect fraud, it also has limitations, such as the new user cold-start problem and the inability to detect certain types of first-party fraud (Source: Document 5 - fraud_detection_system.md).",

    "Gemini 2.5 Flash_answer": "The database selection decision, documented as Architecture Decision Record (ADR) 015, was accepted on September 15, 2024. The decision was made by Alex Kumar, Jennifer Liu, and David Thompson, in consultation with the Database, Infrastructure, and Security Teams (Documents 1, 2).\n\n**Context and Problem:**\nSkyro's existing transaction database, PostgreSQL 13, was nearing its scalability limits, handling approximately 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) (Documents 1, 2).\n\n**Key Requirements and Decision Drivers:**\nThe new database solution needed to address several critical requirements (Documents 1, 2):\n*   **Scalability:** Handle 30,000+ TPS immediately, with room to scale to 100,000 TPS within two years.\n*   **Consistency:** Provide strong consistency (ACID guarantees) for financial transactions.\n*   **Query Support:** Support complex queries for reporting and analytics.\n*   **Durability and Recovery:** Ensure data durability and disaster recovery.\n*   **Latency:** Maintain low latency (<100ms for writes, <50ms for reads).\n*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Be cost-effective at scale.\n\n**Considered Options and Implied Solution:**\nWhile the specific selected option isn't explicitly stated as \"CockroachDB was chosen,\" \"Option 2: CockroachDB\" is presented as a distributed SQL database with PostgreSQL compatibility (Document 5). Its described advantages align directly with the decision drivers:\n*   Strong consistency with a distributed architecture (Document 5).\n*   Horizontal scalability, theoretically unlimited (Document 5).\n*   PostgreSQL wire protocol for minimal application changes (Document 5).\n*   Built-in multi-region support, automatic rebalancing, and failover (Document 5).\n*   Elimination of a single point of failure (Document 5).\n\nAnother option, continuing with PostgreSQL (Option 1), was considered for its existing team expertise and mature ecosystem but was noted for its vertical scaling limitations and the complexity of sharding for massive scale (Document 5).\n\n**Consequences of the Decision:**\nThe accepted decision carries several positive, negative, and neutral consequences (Documents 3, 4):\n\n*   **Positive:**\n    *   Eliminates the database as a scalability bottleneck for the next 3-5 years.\n    *   Supports multi-region deployment for global expansion.\n    *   Reduces operational burden compared to sharding PostgreSQL.\n    *   Maintains strong consistency for financial transactions.\n    *   Improves system reliability through automatic failover.\n\n*   **Negative:**\n    *   Higher infrastructure costs, with an increase of \u20b127,000 per month.\n    *   A 3-month migration period requiring significant engineering effort.\n    *   A team learning curve that may temporarily slow other initiatives.\n    *   Some complex queries will require optimization.\n    *   Newer technology carries some unknown risks.\n\n*   **Neutral:**\n    *   Application code changes will be minimal but required.\n    *   Operational procedures need to be rewritten.\n    *   Backup and disaster recovery processes need updating.",

    "Gemini 2.5 Pro_answer": "Based on the provided documentation from `adr_015_database_selection.md`, a decision was made to select a new database solution to replace the existing PostgreSQL 13 database for transaction storage. While the document does not explicitly name the final selection, the described consequences strongly indicate that a new distributed SQL database, such as the evaluated CockroachDB, was chosen over scaling the existing PostgreSQL instance.\n\n### Decision Context and Drivers\n\n*   **Problem:** The current PostgreSQL 13 database is nearing its scalability limit of 10,000 transactions per second (TPS).\n*   **Requirements:** A new solution was needed to meet several key requirements:\n    *   **Scalability:** Handle an immediate load of 30,000+ TPS with the ability to scale to 100,000 TPS.\n    *   **Consistency:** Provide strong ACID guarantees for financial data.\n    *   **Latency:** Maintain write latency below 100ms and read latency below 50ms.\n    *   **Other:** Support complex queries, ensure data durability, and be cost-effective.\n*   **Status:** The decision is documented as \"Accepted\" on September 15, 2024.\n\n### The Decision and Rationale\n\nThe context suggests the team decided against simply scaling the existing PostgreSQL system and instead chose to migrate to a new technology. This is supported by the listed consequences, which align with the pros of \"Option 2: CockroachDB\" and the cons of sticking with PostgreSQL.\n\n**Key points from the decision's consequences:**\n\n*   **Positive Outcomes:**\n    *   Eliminates the database as a scalability bottleneck for the next 3-5 years.\n    *   Supports multi-region deployment for global expansion.\n    *   Reduces the operational burden that would have come from sharding PostgreSQL.\n    *   Improves system reliability through features like automatic failover.\n*   **Negative Outcomes & Trade-offs:**\n    *   **Increased Cost:** A significant increase in infrastructure costs of $27k/month or \u20b127k/month.\n    *   **Migration Effort:** A planned 3-month migration period requiring dedicated engineering effort.\n    *   **Learning Curve:** A temporary slowdown in other initiatives is expected as the team learns the new technology.\n    *   **Query Optimization:** Some existing complex queries will need to be optimized for the new system.",
